# The Winter Realm

"The Winter Realm is a hostile plane not far from our own. 
It's temperature often hovers well below the freezing point of 
water, even as low as that needed to liquify ammonia..."

The Winter Realm is an ambitious project inspired by that of
The Twilight Forest, among other similar mods, with friends and
foes born of the magics of Winter, varied biomes with a chilling
beauty, mysterious relics of a dark past, and an arch-nemesis,
The Taskmaster.
